## Introduction
This is a series of tools for use in data analysis and 
research in the Greater Manchester Dementia Research Centre 
(GMDRC) hosted by Greater Manchester Mental Health 
Foundation Trust (GMMH). 
The tools are provided for open source use by researchers in 
any field with *pull* requests greatly received for any errors 
or omissions. 
The tools remain imperfect and under active development.
The tools include the **dunnerTools** Python 3 package, for 
data analysis as well as several HTML/js tools for local deployment.
There will be data entry tools and webcalculators as well as 
other useful tidbits.
